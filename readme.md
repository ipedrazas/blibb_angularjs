## Angular.js with :blibb


This is a little example of a mini app written in angular.js that consumes :blibb services.

It is a very minimal application with a table with 2 columns that are populated from the API that generates :blibb for that collection. There is a form that sends data to the server using jQuery since the Angular.js `$http.post` throws a CORS error.
